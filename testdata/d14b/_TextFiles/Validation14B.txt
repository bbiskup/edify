Official validation statement for the UN/EDIFACT Directory D.14B
    
This directory set is the official approved version of UN/EDIFACT 
Directory D.14B.
     
Following the preparation of the directory by the UN/Secretariat, 
it was examined by the UN/CEFACT Bureau Programme Support (BPS) Validation 
Team which has confirmed in a report to the UN/CEFACT Bureau that the content was 
prepared in accordance with approved procedures and is considered 
satisfactory for implementation.
     
A copy of the full audit report is available from the UNECE, 
 e-mail: <uncefact@unece.org>. 
     
The directory is the final version of D.14B for user 
implementation. Under no circumstances will any corrigenda, 
addenda or revisions be issued.
     
If during implementation a user identifies what is considered to 
be an error, this should be notified in a Data Maintenance 
Request (DMR) to allow possible amendments in a subsequent official
approved version of UN/EDIFACT Directory.
     
A DMR form can be obtained from the UN/EDIFACT Entry 
Point website at http://www.unece.org/tradewelcome/areas-of-work/un-centre-for-trade-
facilitation-and-e-business-uncefact/outputs/standards/unedifact/data-maintenance-requests-dmr/dmrforms.html
