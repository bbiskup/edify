1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An interactive Travel, Tourism and Leisure Reservations Response is
       sent by a customer or his agent, to convey the results of a
       reservations request for a Travel, Tourism and Leisure service. The
       Travel, Tourism and Leisure Reservation Request - Interactive
       message (RESREQ) is utilised to provide the interactive request to
       which the RESRSP is used to respond.

1.2    Field of application

       The Reservation response - interactive message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       RESRSP may be used for the following functions within the
       Interactive Reservations Scenario for Travel, Tourism and Leisure:
       
       (1) To respond to an initial reservation request for a hotel, rental
       car, train trip, airline flight, or tour.
       
       (2) To respond to a request to cancel, ignore, or modify a
       reservation.
       
       (3) To display a current or previously made reservation.
