0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Travel, tourism
       and leisure information inquiry response - interactive message
       (TIQRSP) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between
       trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An interactive Travel, tourism and leisure inquiry response is sent
       by a service provider in response to an information request for a
       product or service.

1.2    Field of application

       The Travel, tourism and leisure information inquiry response -
       interactive message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The request message, TIQREQ, for which TIQRSP is the response may be
       used to request lists of information or very detailed information.
       An initial request might request a list of hotel properties in a
       city. Based on the information returned, the next request in the
       scenario might ask for detailed information by specifying the item
       number for a specific property returned in the initial response. The
       next request might then ask for rule details from a list of rules
       specified in the previous response.
       
       TIQRSP may be used for the following functions within the
       interactive scenario for Travel, Tourism and Leisure (TT&L):
       
       (1) to respond to a request for a travel product or service in a
       specific city or geographical region. The response may include a
       list of products, such as a list of hotel properties in a city, a
       list of rental car locations, or schedule of trains.
       
       (2) to respond to a request for detailed information for a specific
       travel product. The response for information for hotel might include
       a description of the property, all the room types, recreation
       facilities at the hotel, transportation to the property, and points
       of interest close to the hotel.
       
       (3) to respond to a request for a specific type of information for a
       particular travel product. The response might be a list of the
       special equipment available for a car type, a list of facilities at
       a train station, or the rules concerning insurance coverage.
       
       (4) to respond to a request for corporate information for the
       supplier of a product or service. The response might include the
       promotions available to the traveller, the supplier's guarantee and
       deposit requirements, or the contact information for the vendor
       code.
