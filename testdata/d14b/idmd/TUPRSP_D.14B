0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Travel, tourism
       and leisure data update response - interactive message (TUPRSP) to
       be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading
       partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An interactive Travel, tourism and leisure data update response is
       sent by a global distribution system (GDS) to respond to a TUPREQ
       that was sent by a supplier to update rates, availability, or
       general or policy information.  It may also be sent by a supplier to
       respond to a TUPREQ message sent by a GDS to update a traveller’s
       profile.

1.2    Field of application

       The Travel, tourism and leisure data update response - interactive
       message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       TUPRSP incorporates the functionality to respond to a data base
       request in the following ways:
        
       (1)  Acknowledge that the update(s) was processed successfully.
       
       (2)  Acknowledge that some of the update(s) were processed
       successfully and list those that were not processed by an item or
       identification number that was assigned by the supplier to each
       update.
       
       (3)  Acknowledge that some of the update(s) were processed
       successfully and return all the update information for those that
       were not processed.
       
       (4)  Respond that no updates were processed and the error code as to
       the reason no updates were processed.
