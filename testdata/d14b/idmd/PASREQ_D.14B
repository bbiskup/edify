1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Travel, tourism and leisure product application status request
       message is sent by either a service supplier to a product supplier
       to ask if the application or product is available for request or by
       a product supplier to a service supplier to notify them that they
       will not be receiving requests during a specified time period.

1.2    Field of application

       The Travel, tourism and leisure product application status request -
       interactive message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       PASREQ may be used for the following functions that facilitate the
       operation of the interactive scenario for travel, tourism and
       leisure:
       
       (1) to ask the supplier of a service or product if the application
       is available for requests. The request may specify an application, a
       message type, a scenario, and a dialogue type.
       
       (2) to notify a service supplier, such as a travel agent system,
       that they will not be taking requests for a specific application(s),
       message type, scenario, or dialogue type, or from specific agents
       based on location.
       
       (3) to ask the service supplier, such as a travel agent system, if
       they can send a message to update their data base.
