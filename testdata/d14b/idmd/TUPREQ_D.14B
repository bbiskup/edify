0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Travel, tourism
       and leisure data update request - interactive message (TUPREQ) to be
       used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An interactive Travel, tourism and leisure data update request is
       sent by a supplier of a product or service to a global distribution
       system (GDS) to update the receiver’s data base for rates,
       availability, policy, and general information. It may also be used
       to initialize the receiver’s system with a new product or service.
       The message may also be sent by a GDS to a supplier when a travel
       agent has made updates to a traveller’s profile or a GDS needs to
       update an agency’s profile.

1.2    Field of application

       The Travel, tourism and leisure data update request - interactive
       message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       TUPREQ may be used for the following types of updates:
       
       (1) Update availability in the GDS system. May be sent when a single
       product is no longer available or may be a weekly or monthly update
       of availability for all services and products.
       
       (2) Update rates in the GDS system.  
       
       (3) Update policy or general information or a corporate account
       profile in the GDS system. This information may be at chain code or
       vendor level or for a specific product location.
       
       (4) Initialize a new product or service in the GDS system.
        
       (5) Update an agency or traveller profile in the supplier system.
       
       The message is made up of five distinct groups for updating the
       information listed above. The information shown in items 1-3 can be
       sent as individual messages or a combination of the three groups can
       be sent in one message to the GDS. The data to initialize a new
       product or service or the update to an agency or traveller profile
       can not be sent with any other update.
       
       The message has the capability to tie an identification number to an
       individual update for purposes of reporting errors in TUPRSP,
       Travel, tourism, and leisure update response message. The sending of
       TUPREQ may be preceded by the sending of the Travel, tourism and
       leisure product application status request and response messages
       (PASREQ/PASRSP).  In this scenario a supplier would send PASREQ to a
       GDS to indicate what type of update is to be made and the number of
       records to be sent. The GDS would respond with the PASRSP to
       indicate if they can accept the update now or if it should be sent
       at a later date and what that date and time is. The GDS may also
       respond with how many records can be sent in one message. The
       supplier would then send TUPREQ at the specified time to update the
       GDS data base.
