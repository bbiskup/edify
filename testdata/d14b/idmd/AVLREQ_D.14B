       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An interactive Travel, Tourism and Leisure Availability Request is
       sent by a customer or his agent, to a service provider to request
       availability for a Travel, Tourism and Leisure service. The Travel,
       Tourism and Leisure Availability Response - Interactive (AVLRSP) is
       utilised to provide an interactive response to the interactive
       availability request.

1.2    Field of application

       The Availability request - interactive message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       AVLREQ may be used for the following functions within the
       Interactive Scenario for Travel, Tourism and Leisure:
       
       (1) to request a general availability for any hotel, rental car,
       train trip, airline flight, or tour in a specific city or
       geographical region for a date or range of dates. The request may
       include selection criteria, such as, the hotel is on the ocean or
       the rooms have fireplaces or the airline flight is non-stop.
       
       (2) to request availability for one or more specific hotels, rental
       cars, train trips, airline flights, or tours for a specific date.
        
       (3) to request rules and rates that may apply to the availability.
