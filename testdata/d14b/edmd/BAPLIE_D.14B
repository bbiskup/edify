0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Bayplan/stowage
       plan occupied and empty locations message (BAPLIE) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved
       in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The bayplan/stowage plan occupied and empty locations message may be
       used for both national and international applications. The reporting
       of empty locations has to be mutually agreed between partners. 
       
       The BAPLIE message is typically exchanged between a container
       terminal operator / stevedore, vessel operator, shipping line,
       ship's master, tonnage center, non-vessel operating common carrier,
       container operator, slot charterer, customs and other authorities.  
       
       It is based on universal practice related to monitoring the
       logistics transport chain and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to transmit information about equipment (mostly
       containers) and goods on a means of transport (typically a container
       vessel), including their location on the means of transport.

1.2    Field of application

       The Bayplan/stowage plan occupied and empty locations message may be
       used for both national and international applications. It is based
       on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       BAPLIE has been designed for application with container vessels
       deployed in scheduled liner services. Message principles, however,
       might be applied in other areas of transportation too.
       
       The message is used to transmit information related only to one
       vessel/voyage combination.   
       
       Information transmitted by the message is related to only one port
       of call.
       It shows the status of cargo on board the vessel after departure
       from this port and by this also shows the arrival status at vessel's
        next port of call. 
       
       If created before vessel's departure, the message might be used to
       describe planned status. If created after departure, it describes
       vessel's actual status.
        
       Typically the message transmits information on all containers and
       other goods on board the vessel (Full BAPLIE). In that case the
       BAPLIE shows the total amount of occupied locations, cargo and
       containers on board the vessel. 
       It is also possible to transmit only cargo related to a single
       container operator (Part BAPLIE). 
        
       The message contains the following vessel related information:
       Vessel name and identifier, related port and next port of call,
       arrival and departure dates at the related and next port of call.
        
       The message contains the following cargo related information:
       Equipment ID, size-type code, weight, stowage location on the vessel
       and the responsible operator party, port of loading and discharge.
       Dependent on nature of cargo further attributes such as temperature
       control, identification of dangerous goods, non-standard dimensions,
       handling requirements may be added.
       
       A full BAPLIE contains information about stowage locations which
       cannot be used for loading equipment.
